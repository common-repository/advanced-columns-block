=== Built on the foundations of CSS Grid ===

Advanced Columns runs on CSS Grid. With such a powerful foundation, there are no limits to what you can build.

Since column blocks templates are dynamically rendered, styles are dynamically processed too, and are inlined in page only when you actually need them: this way, your pages will perform better in speed tests, and put you in control of their output.

=== Data portability in an instant ===

With a robust set of block transforms: whether you’re coming from Core columns, you’ve been using Core groups or even our Grids plugin, your data and styles can be automatically brought over to Advanced Columns with a single click.

The choice is yours regarding which blocks to use for your layout. With Advanced Columns one thing is for sure: you are the one in control.

=== Semantically robust markup and style ===

We know what effect heavy markups make, right? Pages become unnecessarily heavy, the code quickly becomes unreadable, and they even mess up your text-to-markup ratio.

Advanced Columns relies on minimal markup to render, and offers the tools to alter the semantics of the generated HTML to fit your needs.

=== Extensible, future-proof and optimized ===

As developers, we like having control. That's why, through various hooks and filters, Advanced Columns provides you with all the tools you need to extend the plugin as you please.

We prioritize flexibility, and Advanced Columns, with its robust data structure, is a versatile solution that simplifies idea implementation. You know what else we like? Speed! All these goodies are backed up by an optimized platform that has performance at its core.

=== Not yet another page builder ===

Advanced Columns is embracing the power and flexibility of the Site Editor: by following WordPress Core closely, we are ensuring that the plugin stays lean, efficient and secure.

How cool would it be to add a truly problem-solving plugin to your website and be sure that it won't mess up your performance? Well, Advanced Columns is that plugin.

=== The solution for the next generation of WordPress projects ===

Advanced Columns has been designed to be included in a project with ease and its controls be targeted to specific user roles, so that your clients won't accidentally mess up your beautiful layouts.

The plugin integrates seamlessly with Block Themes: this means that you'll be able to modify your theme's theme.json file and instantly see those changes reflected on our blocks' controls. Take borders, spacing values, or even colors for example: Advanced Columns will work as one with your theme!
